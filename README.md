# script.on.file

Two addins that can be used to run an action on another machine (for
example Linux PC) with the selected file as argument.

This is currently a bit of a mess, as the implementation changed and I
don't have time to keep this up to date.

## Kodi Addin: script.on.file

## Kodi Addin: context.on.file

## A Word on Copyright

I used other plugins to get inspired. For example the Kodi Hello World plugin/script and also Trakt - Contextmenu.
I bluntly copy/pasted parts of the plugins to create this one.
